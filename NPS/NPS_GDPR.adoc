With the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) now in full swing, chances are that some area of your business must rapidly alter how it manages the personal information and data of EU persons. With potential fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue for a GDPR violation, it is behooved of every business to ensure compliance with these regulations. NetApp Hybrid Cloud can provide your company the competitive advantage of accelerating time to market in this highly regulated space.

By leveraging a hybrid cloud solution, organizations mitigate compliance risks associated with GDPR. Businesses may decide to leverage the cloud for less sensitive data all while storing more sensitive data on prem. The NetApp portfolio may be leveraged in several different ways to achieve the desired level of resiliency, cost-savings, and compute capacity while still maintaining compliance. Consider the following two scenarios:

1.  *On-Prem All Flash FAS (AFF) and Cloud Volumes Service*
A NetApp AFF A800 cluster delivers ultra-low latency of below 200 microsecond and massive throughput of up to 300 GB/s powered by a combination of NVMe SSDs and NVMe/FC connectivity. In addition to being able to run your apps with unprecedented speed and scale you can maintain full control of the data on-prem.

NetApp Cloud Volumes offers customers a fully-managed, cloud-native file storage service that integrates with on-prem AFF system via NetApp CloudSync. This means you can offload less secure data into the cloud seamlessly. Furthermore, if you have archival regulation requiring long term retention, you may choose to move content to an even lower, long-term storage tier reducing cost and maintaining even the most stringent record-keeping requirements.

2. *NetApp Private Storage (NPS) for Cloud*
Each NetApp Private Storage for Cloud solution consists of a NetApp AFF storage system.  The NPS systems are collocated in an Equinix data center and are directly connected with a service provider’s cloud compute using a dedicated, high-bandwidth, low-latency network connection. Leverage the scalability of cloud compute while honoring data privacy, regulatory, and sovereignty requirements. NPS for Cloud is based on the NetApp ONTAP® storage operating system, offering a common storage management framework, or data fabric, with your on-premises data center. Using a single known operating system, you secure your regulated data on-prem and your less stringent data in the cloud.

The flexibility built into the NetApp portfolio enables customers to meet GDPR requirements without compromising on cost, speed or resiliency. Deploy as your needs demand.
